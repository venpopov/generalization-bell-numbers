## 1. Introduction

Given a sequence $a = (a_0, a_1, \ldots)$, the binomial transform is the procedure that maps it to a new sequence $b = (b_0,b_1,...)$ as follows:

$$
b_n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a_k
$$

Bernstein and Sloane @bernstein1995 studied a number of what they call "Eigen sequences" of the various such transformations - sequences $a$ which when transformed one or more times shift by one or more places but are otherwise preserved. Such sequences show a "self-similarity" under an iterated transform and understanding why this self-similarity occurs often reveals new properties or relations between different integer sequences.

Perhaps the most famous case of a binomial-transform invariant sequence is that of the Bell numbers ([A000110](https://oeis.org/A000110)), which shift one place to the left after a single binomial transformation:

$$
B_{n+1} = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} B_k
$$

The Bell numbers count the total number of partitions of an n-element set and they are part of a rich combinatorial structure that involves the Stirling numbers the of the second kind ([A008277](https://oeis.org/A008277)), Touchard polynomials @weisstein, the exponential function and linear operators acting on it @dattoliTouchardPolynomialsGeneralized2010.

In this paper I study a new generalization of the Bell numbers defined by the following property:

$$
A_{n+m} = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} m^{n-k} A_k
$$

These are sequences that shift to the left by $m$ places after $m$ applications of the binomial transform. The case $m=1$ corresponds to the Bell numbers, and $m=2$ corresponds to sequences [A007472](https://oeis.org/A007472), [A351143](https://oeis.org/search?q=1,0,1,2,5,16&language=english&go=Search) and [A351028](https://oeis.org/A351028), which shift by 2 places left after 2 binomial transformations (sequences for $m>2$ are not currently present in OEIS). Although the sequences for $m=2$ are listed in OEIS, little is known about their properties.

In the remainder of this paper I show that the m-fold binomialâ€“shift-invariance property that characterizes these sequences arises from a combinatorial structure that mirrors that of the regular Bell numbers. I show that each such m-Bell sequence corresponds to the row sums of new Stirling-like arrays, motivating the name m-Stirling numbers (which come in dual pairs). The m-Bell numbers have explicit exponential generating functions that are the solutions of ordinary differential equations of order $m$. Each of the associated m-Stirling arrays arises as the coefficients of polynomials that result from the application of the exponential shift operator to hypergeometric functions, which have simple forms for $m=1$ (in terms of the exponential function) and $m=2$ (in terms of modified Bessel functions of the first and second kinds). I conclude by providing a combinatorial interpretation for the general case as well as showing a connection to the Conway-Maxwell-Poisson distribution @shmueliUsefulDistributionFitting2005.

## 2. The m-Stirling numbers

Recall that the Bell numbers are the row sums of a triangle array formed by the Stirling numbers of the second kind:

$$
\begin{align}
B_n = \sum_{k=0}^{n}\Stirling{n}{k},
\end{align}
$$
